# Kancolle Kai Ni
Welcome to the 'remastered' version of a very famous Japanese web browser anime game: Kantai Collection or Kancolle. I started this project to help practice and improve my full stack skills of Django and Javascript with Next JS in a setting that I always wanted to explore: Video Games. I want to use this project as well to discover the mindset of what game development is in an enviornment that I am familiar with before trying out full game engines like Unity and Unreal. As I delved into the world of anime, I discovered this franchise: both the show and the game and fell in love with its not only cute characters but very interesting concept.

# Stack
This project will be a full stack of Django backend and Next JS frontend using typescript.

# Software
- Visual Studio
- Figma
- Obsidian

## Misc
Each app in django holds an md file with a more in depth explanation of each part of the project
